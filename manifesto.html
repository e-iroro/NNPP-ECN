                <p>Dear Compatriots and good people of our great Party,  I came before you earlier on to express my interest to vie for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under our Political Platform, the NNPP. I will like to first say Thank you all for being here, your warm welcome, and friendly support. I know you are here because our country has come to a crossroad. In fact, this is going to be the most critical election of our lifetime. You have to choose whether our society makes a U-turn or moves forward to a great future and prosperity. It’s up to us, whether we change the existing political landscape of our country or not. Loads of issues divide us into small confronting groups but I would rather focus on the common grounds that we all share and need to cultivate. I assure you that a vote for me is a vote for self liberation and purpose actualization. </p><br>
                    <p>I am no one to lament over challenges, I confront them head on and profer solutions and as a woman, nature bestowed on me as a good manager of resources and not just a home maker. We are not just the most populous African Nation, we are also blessed with numerous Natural Resources and these resources are currently being under utilized and misused. Nigerians can not continue to lack in abundance. It’s time we rise above our travails. On this note and taking into consideration that our party stands for Peace, Equity and Progress hence I designed our manifesto on a 7-Point Agenda to reflect our Party’s ideologies thus; </p> <br>
